// Problems:
// A staircase is given with a non-negative cost per each step. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. Create a solution to find the minimum sum of costs to reach the top (finishing the payments including cost[-2] or cost[-1]). You can either start at cost[0] or cost[1].
 
// Examples:
// climbingStairs([0, 2, 2, 1]) ➞ 2
// climbingStairs([0, 2, 3, 2]) ➞ 3
// climbingStairs([10, 15, 20]) ➞ 15
// climbingStairs([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) ➞ 0
 
// Clue:
// Let dp[i] be the cost to climb the i-th staircase to from 0-th or 1-th step. Hence dp[i] = cost[i] + min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]). Since dp[i-1] and dp[i-2] are needed to compute the cost of traveling from i-th step, a bottom-up approach can be used to solve the problem. The answer will be the minimum cost of reaching n-1th stair and n-2th stair. Compute the dp[] array in a bottom-up manner.

const climbingStairs = (costStep) => {
    for (let i = costStep.length - 3; i >= 0; i--) {
        costStep[i] += Math.min(costStep[i + 1], costStep[i + 2]);
    }
    console.log(Math.min(costStep[0], costStep[1]));
};
